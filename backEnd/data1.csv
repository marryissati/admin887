We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.



Job Description


What’s the role?

Etsy's payments platform helps millions of Etsy sellers safely and securely make transactions within our marketplace. Available in 43 countries, Etsy Payments enables buyers and sellers to transact in 19 currencies and offers 12 different methods to pay for items on our site.

The Payments team at Etsy is committed to creating and maintaining a resilient, frictionless, and scalable payments platform. This role offers an outstanding challenge that requires designers to work within ambiguous and complex problem spaces. As a Senior Product Designer, you will craft user experiences that strengthen the trust users have in the platform by simplifying complicated workflows for our sellers. You will be responsible for design experimentation on our existing features, and working with partners to develop and drive the direction of early-stage products focused on rapidly growing our platform to new and emerging markets.

What’s product design like at Etsy?

Typically, product designers at Etsy work in a squad with a product manager, 3-7 engineers, a researcher, and an analyst.Together they drive their own part of Etsy, deliver solutions to challenging problems and get feedback directly from customers.

Day-to-day looks like:

Discovering insights, opportunities, and requirements
Testing prototypes and hypotheses with users to collect feedback
Launching experiments and evaluating how they perform and how to iterate
Sharing your work to peers and leadership, async and in-person
Taking part in weekly design critiques, workshops, all hands, and squad meetings
Detailing your process and decisions
Developing insight for Etsy users
Team with product and engineering regularly to effectively dive into problem spaces and come up with solutions together


Qualifications


Senior level at Etsy means:

You can run independently or give direction to designers within your team
You can lead workshops and optimally align the group around a vision and approach
You have a track record of designing complex flows and customer journeys
You can think and design at a system level, not just interface elements or pages
You’ll regularly make use of your soft skills: listening, negotiating, decision-making
You’ll spend time providing mentorship to other designers
You’ll play a key part in hiring, onboarding, and improving our team’s culture and engagement

Qualities we value in designers:

Effective articulation of ideas and design solutions
Expressing feedback with courtesy and candor
Tolerance for ambiguity and healthy curiosity
Translation of quantitative & qualitative insights into design decisions
Ability to challenge status quo/or established norms

Etsy's Data Engineering department builds systems and infrastructure and writes data pipelines for collecting, storing, and analyzing huge sets of data in batch and streaming contexts. As a member of the Data Pipeliners team, you'll help us identify, extract, and write shared data pipelines that power hundreds to thousands of downstream data processing jobs; you'll be responsible for designing new methods and tooling for ensuring the validity and quality of our data; and you will help other teams write robust data pipelines in Scala Spark, BigQuery SQL, and Kafka Streams. We value curiosity, enthusiasm, responsibility and generosity of spirit.

We're looking for a flexible engineer who cares about the data that flows through pipelines and the internal customers who will use that data. We care more about being excited to pivot to the appropriate tool for the job than having deep expertise in single systems. We work in Scala, Python, Java, and SQL, and we work with technologies like Spark, Kafka, Scalding, Airflow, Looker, Dataproc, and BigQuery. Experience with any of these is helpful but not required.

Our team is leading the company's migration from Scalding to Spark by developing data onboarding materials, defining best practices, and adding tooling to ensure that pipelines are well-written.

ABOUT YOU

You understand that being an effective software engineer is about communicating with people as much as it is about writing code.

You are willing to work with and improve code you did not originally write.

You are generous with your time and experience, and can mentor and learn from other engineers.

You can tackle unconstrained problems and know when to seek help.

You are flexible with languages and tools and are willing to learn whatever is necessary to get the job done.
